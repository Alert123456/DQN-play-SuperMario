# DQN-play-SuperMario
Use the deep reinforcement learning algorithm DQN to play the game SuperMario.  
The game environment is come from https://github.com/justinmeister/Mario-Level-1.git  
The agent performance is not good enough.Actually there is a gap between my expectations and the fact.This kind of learning algorithms are magical and hard to control.There must be some internal logic between the agent performance and a bunch of hyperparameters.And it is important to note that the supermariobros game is complicated than Atari games in gym,the game frame is more rich and has more changes. 
## This project is to be continue!
